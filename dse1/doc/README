      A Dynamic Systems Estimation library. 
         Paul Gilbert, Bank of Canada

This library implements an object oriented approach to time series modeling, 
testing of forecasting models, and testing of estimation algorithms.

The latest version of the library is available at

Please check the web site for more recent versions of the library.
   
Also at that web location is a "Brief User's Guide" in both postscript 
(guide.ps) and PDF (guide.pdf) formats. In R the help documentation is added to
R's help system when the package is installed. In Splus the help documention is
available in an HTML based help facility which should be installed in the 
directory html at the location in your file system where the library is 
installed. Point your browser at dsehome.htm to begin.
