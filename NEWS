		CHANGES IN DSE AND DSEPLUS VERSION 2003.2-1

Changes (Possibly) Affecting Users

    o	several program names have been revised so as to avoid confusion 
	with methods for generics with similar names. For this reason, the
	new Users' Guide should be used, despite its problems.

    o	the Users' guide is (being) broken down into pieces for each 
    	package and re-written using Sweave (with .Stex files in inst/doc).
	The Users' Guide (dse-guide.pdf) is still placed in dse1/inst/doc
	as the bundle structure does not have a place for documentation.

    o	the old package syskern has been divided into setRNG which is included
	with dse and a new package syskern which is moved to dseplus.

    o	most routines have been convert to use La.svd and La.eigen in place 
    	of svd and eigen (and test values were revised slightly in some cases).

    o	DSE.HOME has been removed and .path.package is used in its place.

    o	version.dse now gives the version of each package.

Changes Affecting Development

    o	testing in Makefiles has been revised so code (Rcode+tests) is the 
	only inter-package dependency. Examples, demos, and guides do not 
	affect other packages.

    o	reliance on bundle structure is largely removed, and Makefiles 
	have been re-organized to reflect this.
