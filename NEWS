		CHANGES IN DSE AND DSEPLUS VERSION 2003.9-1

Changes (Possibly) Affecting Users

    o	fixed bug in fixConstants which prevented setting of arbitrary elements
        in SS models to constant (non-parameter) values other than 0 or 1. The
	documentation of fixConstants was also improved.

    o	fixed bug causing occassional seg faults in smoother.

    o	fixed bug preventing estMaxLik properly setting the estimated parameters
        in SS models (so they appeared to be unchanged).

    o	usage of random seed tightened up to correspond to R 1.8.0

    o	minor documentation errors caught by new tools() have been fixed.

Changes Affecting Development

    o	use of tools() in Makefiles has been been further refined.

    o	prcomp eliminated as version in R 1.8.0 now supports complex matrix.
    

    
		CHANGES IN DSE AND DSEPLUS VERSION 2003.6-1

Changes (Possibly) Affecting Users

    o	several more program names have been revised so as to avoid confusion 
	with methods for generics with similar names. (That is, function 
	foo.bar has been changed to fooBar, or to barFoo in some cases.)
    o	DSEversion (previously version.DSE) gives the version of 
    	each package.

Changes Affecting Development

    o	testing in Makefiles has been been further refined.

		CHANGES IN DSE AND DSEPLUS VERSION 2003.4-1

Changes (Possibly) Affecting Users

    o	dseplus which works with the previous dse changes is released.
    
Changes Affecting Development

    o	testing in Makefiles has been been further refined.
    o	test tolerances in dseplus have been adjusted for R 1.7.0 and Splus 3.3.
    o	very minor changes because of R 1.7.0 name spaces.

		CHANGES IN DSE AND DSEPLUS VERSION 2003.2-1

Changes (Possibly) Affecting Users

    o	several program names have been revised so as to avoid confusion 
	with methods for generics with similar names. For this reason, the
	new Users' Guide should be used, despite its problems.

    o	the Users' guide is (being) broken down into pieces for each 
    	package and re-written using Sweave (with .Stex files in inst/doc).
	The Users' Guide (dse-guide.pdf) is still placed in dse1/inst/doc
	as the bundle structure does not have a place for documentation.

    o	the old package syskern has been divided into setRNG which is included
	with dse and a new package syskern which is moved to dseplus.

    o	most routines have been convert to use La.svd and La.eigen in place 
    	of svd and eigen (and test values were revised slightly in some cases).

    o	DSE.HOME has been removed and .path.package is used in its place.

    o	version.DSE now gives the version of each package.

Changes Affecting Development

    o	testing in Makefiles has been revised so code (Rcode+tests) is the 
	only inter-package dependency. Examples, demos, and guides do not 
	affect other packages.

    o	reliance on bundle structure is largely removed, and Makefiles 
	have been re-organized to reflect this.
